# Inclusive-Digital-Literacy-Curriculum-for-Blind-Students

Designed and implemented an accessible digital literacy curriculum for blind and low-vision students using tactile, audio, and screen reader-based learning methods. The module includes:

Hands-on identification of computer hardware (CPU, monitor, UPS, speakers, ports)

Exploration of QWERTY keyboard layout with finger-wise key mapping and modifier key usage

Haptic and auditory feedback activities (vibrations, fan sound, boot-up cues)

Use of screen readers (NVDA, Narrator) to navigate and operate the system

Interactive tasks to build independence in using USB ports, launching apps, and recognizing system states
